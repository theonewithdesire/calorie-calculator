## 🧮 How It Works

The calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to determine your daily calorie needs:

- **For men**: BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height - 5 × age + 5
- **For women**: BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height - 5 × age - 161

1. Activity level (sedentary to very active)
2. Your goal (±500 calories for weight loss/gain)
